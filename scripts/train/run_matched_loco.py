rawmod_matched_loco — matched-only, causal-label, leave-one-chemistry-out (LOCO)
training with a paired-contrastive (SupCon) objective.

WHY THIS EXPERIMENT
-------------------
Every earlier pipeline mixed motif-derived labels into training, where
P(mod | context) approx 0.94 (e.g. Dam methylates ~100% of GATC), so sequence
predicts the label and the model memorises the recognition motif — firing on
UNMODIFIED DNA (deepmod_full_pipeline2/datasets.md sec 5a). Post-hoc fixes
(flank masking, ch9 fix, DANN, SupCon-on-mixed) all failed to remove it.

This experiment removes the shortcut *at the source* by training ONLY on samples
that have a matched UNMODIFIED counterpart, so every label is causal:

  ONT    : {5mC,5hmC,6mA}.h5 positives  vs  control.h5 negatives   (synthetic control)
  SPO1   : bc06/07 native positives     vs  bc01-05 amplicon negs  (amplification strips mods)
  HP26695: WT native positives          vs  WGA negatives          (whole-genome amplified)

Within a matched sample the SAME genomic context appears as a modified positive
AND an unmodified negative, so P(mod | context) = 0.5 by construction and the
motif shortcut is structurally unavailable — the amplification analogue of a
Dam-knockout (datasets.md sec 6).

CHEMISTRY TYPING (per modified image)
  ONT   -> the file's modification name (5mC / 5hmC / 6mA)
  SPO1  -> modkit dominant-code map (mod_types.build_umces_mod_map):
           forward-T -> 5hmU (precedence), else m/h/a -> 5mC/5hmC/6mA
  HP WT -> centre reference base: A/T -> 6mA, C/G -> 4mC (both strands)

Chemistries present in the core matched pool: 5hmU, 5mC, 5hmC, 6mA, 4mC.

CURRICULUM DATA (EXTRA_ORGANISMS=1 / INCLUDE_HUMAN=1, BENCH:: members)
7 single-sample WT/native benchmark organisms (Kulkarni et al. 2024) + hg001/
hg002 -- no matched unmodified twin, so they never enter curriculum stage 1
(paired anchors), but ARE unioned into every fold's stage-2 training by
default (see fit()'s `extra` param). chem_array() never assigns these images a
chemistry label (they sit at chem=''), and several BENCH:: organisms carry the
SAME chemistry as a core-pool target under a DIFFERENT name -- unaddressed,
this leaks that "held-out" chemistry straight into training. Measured: with
both flags on, BENCH:: leaks 131,660 6mA / 100,138 5mC / 4,807 4mC images into
every fold regardless of which core chemistry is held out, versus core-pool
censuses of only 40,452 / 5,870 / 4,780 for those three -- the leak outweighs
the intended holdout by 3x-17x. 5hmC and 5hmU are never present in BENCH::
and are unaffected.
FIX: BENCH_ORG_CHEMS records each organism's real (REBASE/motif-characterized)
chemistry content; loco_<CHEM> strips any BENCH:: organism whose set contains
the held-out CHEM out of `extra_idx` before training, so "held out" means
never-seen-anywhere, not just absent from the core pool. This fix is applied
for loco_<CHEM> only -- subset_<...> (below) evaluates one trained model
against MULTIPLE held-out targets at once, so a single clean exclusion isn't
well-defined there; read subset_ chemistry-leak numbers for 6mA/5mC/4mC with
that caveat.

FOLDS (one SLURM job each)
  loco_<CHEM>  leave-one-chemistry-out (CHEM in 5hmU/4mC/6mA/5mC/5hmC):
     train = {positives typed != CHEM}  U  {85% of controls, position-grouped}
              U  {BENCH:: curriculum data, minus organisms carrying CHEM}
     test  = {positives typed == CHEM}  U  {15% controls, from the organism(s)
              carrying CHEM AND whose centre ref base matches CHEM's target
              base(s)} -- a pure signal contrast (e.g. modified-T vs unmodified-T
              for 5hmU), not a trivial base-composition split.
     This is the zero-shot "modification-agnostic" test: the model is scored on a
     chemistry it never saw ANYWHERE in training, using causal negatives from
     the same sample. These 5 folds, together with mixed and the 3
     logo_<group> folds, form the primary evaluation for this pipeline.
  logo_<group>  leave-one-organism-group-out (group in bacteria/plant/mammal,
     see LOGO_GROUPS): holds out entire BENCH:: organism(s) -- never in stage-2
     training, scored zero-shot as their own test set. logo_bacteria adds
     BGCTRL:: (non-motif background negatives) as test-only negatives, since
     the 6 bacterial BENCH:: datasets are 100% positive on their own.
  subset_<c1>+<c2>[+c3]  training-diversity sweep (2-4 of the 5 CHEMS in
     training; see parse_subset_fold): a single model trained on exactly this
     chemistry subset is zero-shot-evaluated against every chemistry NOT in
     it, so C(5,2)+C(5,3)+C(5,4)=25 unique subsets cover the full "AUROC vs
     #training-chemistries" sweep -- the 5 size-4 subsets are exactly the
     loco_<CHEM> folds above, reused rather than retrained. Exploratory, and
     NOT covered by the leak fix -- see caveat above.
  mixed        position-grouped 85/15 split over the whole matched pool
               (in-distribution reference point).

MODEL: ConvFormerV2(supcon_dim=SUPCON_DIM, default 128) trained by
run_pipeline.train_one_model with total loss BCE + SUPCON_WEIGHT*SupCon on the
causal labels. All model/train/eval code is imported from the repo; this file
only assembles the matched pool and defines the LOCO splits.
